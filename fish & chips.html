        <li>4 white fish fillets (like cod, haddock, or pollock)   </li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour                                </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder                               </li>
        <li>1 cup cold sparkling water or club soda                </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch (for extra crispiness)         </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt                                        </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper                              </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika (optional)                          </li>
        <li>Oil for frying (vegetable oil or canola oil)           </li>

    <p>Directions: </p>
	  
	<ul> 
	
	  <li>Prepare the Chips (Fries):</li>
	      <ol>
            <li>Peel and slice the potatoes into thick, chunky chips. You can leave the skin on if you prefer a more rustic style.                                        </li>
            <li>Rinse the potato slices under cold water to remove excess starch, then pat them dry with paper towels.                                                    </li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or a large, heavy-bottomed pot to about 320°F (160°C).                                                                           </li>
            <li>Fry the chips in batches for about 5-6 minutes until they begin to soften but haven’t browned. Remove them from the oil and drain on paper towels.        </li>
            <li>Increase the oil temperature to 375°F (190°C).                                                                                                            </li>
            <li>Fry the chips again for another 3-4 minutes until golden brown and crispy. Remove, drain, and season with salt.                                           </li>
          </ol>                                                                                                                                                           
																																										  
	   <li>Prepare the Fish:                                                                                                                                              </li>
           <ol>                                                                                                                                                           
   		    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper.                                                                               </li>
            <li>Slowly whisk in the beer (or sparkling water) until you have a smooth, thick batter.                                                                      </li>
            <li>Pat the fish fillets dry with paper towels and lightly coat them in a bit of flour to help the batter stick.                                              </li>
            <li>Heat the oil in your fryer or pan to 350°F (175°C).                                                                                                       </li>
            <li>Dip each fish fillet into the batter, ensuring it's fully coated, then carefully lower it into the hot oil.                                               </li>
            <li>Fry the fish for about 4-5 minutes per side, or until golden and crispy. The fish should flake easily when done.                                          </li>
            <li>Remove the fish and drain on paper towels.                                                                                                                </li>
            <li>Serve the crispy fish fillets alongside the chips, and garnish with lemon wedges.                                                                         </li>
            <li>Enjoy your homemade Fish and Chips!                                                                                                                       </li>
