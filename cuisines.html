      <h3> Alfredo Pasta </h3> 
      <li>Alfredo Pasta might have remained a local Roman specialty if it were not for Hollywood actors Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, who visited Rome on their honeymoon in the 1920s.
        They dined at Alfredos restaurant, fell in love with the dish, and reportedly brought the recipe back to the United States.</li>

    <h3> Mandi </h3>

    <li>Mandi is a classic dish that hails from Yemen and has gained widespread popularity across the Arabian Peninsula and beyond, particularly in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates. The dish is renowned for its unique cooking method, where meat, typically lamb or chicken, is slow-cooked with rice, allowing the flavors to blend deeply and create a rich, savory taste.</li>
