      <h3> Alfredo Pasta </h3> 
      <li>Alfredo Pasta might have remained a local Roman specialty if it were not for Hollywood actors Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, who visited Rome on their honeymoon in the 1920s.
        They dined at Alfredos restaurant, fell in love with the dish, and reportedly brought the recipe back to the United States.</li>

          <h3> Pizza </h3>


        <li>The concept of pizza begins with the use of flatbreads in ancient civilizations. Both the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans ate bread topped with oils, herbs, and other ingredients.
          These early flatbreads resemble what we now consider pizza, though they were much simpler.</li>

                  <h3> fish & chips </h3>  

                  
            <li>The introduction of fried fish to Britain is often credited to Jewish immigrants from Spain and Portugal who settled in England in the 17th century. 
              These Jews, known as Sephardic Jews, prepared fish by frying it in oil, a practice known as "pescado frito".
              This cooking method was adapted in Britain and became popular, especially in London and coastal towns.</li>
